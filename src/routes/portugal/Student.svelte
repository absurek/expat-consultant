      <h3>Getting a Job as a Student</h3>
    </svelte:fragment>
    <svelte:fragment slot="content">
      <p>
        As an international student, you are allowed to work part-time while studying in Portugal. However, there are
        certain restrictions on the number of working hours allowed per week, which is usually up to 20 hours. It is
        also important to note that the job market in Portugal can be competitive, especially for non-Portuguese
        speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minimum wage in Portugal is currently €775 per month, but as a student, you may not necessarily earn this
        amount. The hourly wage for part-time jobs can vary depending on the industry and the specific job, but it is
        typically around €4-€6 per hour. Some common part-time jobs for students in Portugal include working in

      <h3>Permanent Residency and Citizenship</h3>
    </svelte:fragment>
    <svelte:fragment slot="content">
      <p>
        It is possible for students to obtain permanent residency in Portugal after completing their studies and then
        apply for Portuguese citizenship. To be eligible for permanent residency, students must have a valid residence
        permit and have lived in Portugal for at least five consecutive years. They must also demonstrate sufficient
        knowledge of the Portuguese language and have no criminal record.
      </p>
      <p>
        After obtaining permanent residency, students can then apply for Portuguese citizenship after an additional year
        of residency, making it a total of six years of residency in Portugal. Citizenship provides the right to live
        and work in Portugal without any restrictions, as well as the ability to travel freely throughout the European
        Union.

      <h3>Learning Portuguese</h3>
    </svelte:fragment>
    <svelte:fragment slot="content">
      <p>
        The amount of time it takes to learn Portuguese to an A2 level can vary depending on several factors, such as
        the student's language learning abilities, the amount of time dedicated to studying, and the intensity and
        quality of the language program or course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, it can take anywhere from 150 to 200 hours of study to reach an A2 level in Portuguese. This equates
        to about 6-8 weeks of intensive study, or 3-6 months of regular study. However, it’s important to note that
        everyone learns at their own pace, so the time it takes to reach an A2 level may vary from person to person.

    <svelte:fragment slot="content">
      <p>
        Many people in Portugal can speak English, especially in tourist areas and major cities. English is widely
        taught in schools and is commonly used in business, so it is not difficult to find English speakers in Portugal.
